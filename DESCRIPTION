Description: Tools for preparing data and models for the MOSAIC framework. The MOSAIC framework 
     simulates the transmission dynamics of cholera in Sub-Saharan Africa and provides tools 
     to understand the impact of interventions, such as vaccination, as well as large-scale 
     drivers like climate change.
