\title{Simple Bias Correction for ENSO Data with Different Climatological Baselines}
\usage{
adjust_baseline(historical, forecast, n_overlap = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{historical}{Numeric vector of historical observations (degrees Celsius).
Use NA for future periods without observations.}

\item{forecast}{Numeric vector of forecast values (degrees Celsius), same
length as historical. Use NA for periods without forecasts.}

\item{n_overlap}{Integer number of timesteps from end of overlap period to
use for bias calculation. If NULL or Inf, uses all available overlap points.
Default: NULL (all overlap).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{historical}{Original historical observations vector.}
\item{forecast}{Original forecast vector.}
\item{forecast_corrected}{Bias-corrected forecast vector (forecast - bias).}
\item{combined}{Combined time series: historical takes priority, then corrected forecast.}
\item{bias}{Estimated mean bias (degrees Celsius) calculated as mean(forecast - historical).}
\item{se}{Standard error of the bias estimate.}
\item{n_overlap}{Number of overlap points used for bias calculation.}
\item{differences}{Raw differences (forecast - historical) during overlap period used for bias estimation.}
}
\description{
Harmonizes ENSO forecast data from different sources (BOM, IRI) to NOAA's
1991-2020 baseline by estimating and removing systematic bias during an
overlap period where both historical observations and archived forecasts exist.
}
\details{
Three ENSO data sources use different climatological baselines, creating
systematic offsets of 0.1-0.3°C:
\itemize{
\item NOAA Historical: 1991-2020 baseline (reference)
\item BOM Forecasts: 1981-2010 baseline (typically +0.15 to +0.25°C warmer)
\item IRI Ensemble: Mixed baselines (typically +0.20 to +0.30°C warmer)
}

The function estimates bias as the mean difference during the overlap period
and subtracts it from forecast values to harmonize them to NOAA's baseline.
A minimum of 12 months overlap is recommended to capture seasonal cycles.

For IRI data, ensure values are converted to degrees Celsius (divide by 100)
before passing to this function, as IRI stores values in hundredths.
