\title{Attach MOSAIC Python Environment}
\usage{
attach_mosaic_env(silent = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{silent}{Logical. If TRUE, suppresses informational messages. Default: FALSE.}
}
\value{
Invisible TRUE if successful, stops with error otherwise
}
\description{
Explicitly attaches the r-mosaic Python environment to the current R session.
This function initializes Python with the r-mosaic environment, making all
MOSAIC Python dependencies (laser_cholera, torch, zuko, etc.) available.

The function:
\itemize{
\item Sets the RETICULATE_PYTHON environment variable
\item Initializes Python with r-mosaic
\item Verifies the environment is working
\item Provides clear error messages if attachment fails
}
}
\details{
This function is called automatically when MOSAIC is loaded (via .onAttach).
You typically don't need to call it manually unless:
\itemize{
\item You want to verify the Python environment is working
\item You detached and want to re-attach without restarting R
\item You're writing a script that needs explicit environment control
}

Once Python is initialized, reticulate prevents switching to a different
environment without restarting R. If Python is already initialized with
a different environment, this function will fail with an error message
instructing you to restart R.

# Manually attach MOSAIC environment
attach_mosaic_env()

# Attach silently (no messages)
attach_mosaic_env(silent = TRUE)

# Verify after attaching
