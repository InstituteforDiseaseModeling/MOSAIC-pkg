\title{Calculate log-likelihood for Negative Binomial-distributed count data}
\usage{
calc_log_likelihood_negbin(
  observed,
  estimated,
  k = NULL,
  weights = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{observed}{Integer vector of observed non-negative counts (e.g., cases, deaths).}

\item{estimated}{Numeric vector of expected values from the model (same length as \code{observed}).}

\item{k}{Numeric scalar; dispersion parameter. If \code{NULL}, it is estimated via method of moments.}

\item{weights}{Optional numeric vector of non-negative weights, same length as \code{observed}.
Default is \code{NULL}, which sets all weights to 1.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, prints diagnostics including estimated dispersion and total log-likelihood.}
}
\value{
A scalar representing the total log-likelihood (numeric).
}
\description{
Computes the total log-likelihood for count data under the Negative Binomial distribution,
using the gamma-function formulation. Each observation can be weighted.
}
\details{
Weighted log-likelihood is summed across all observations. Overdispersion is accounted for by \eqn{k}.
