\title{Calculate log-likelihood for Normally-distributed continuous data}
\usage{
calc_log_likelihood_normal(observed, estimated, weights = NULL, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{observed}{Numeric vector of observed continuous values.}

\item{estimated}{Numeric vector of model-predicted means.}

\item{weights}{Optional numeric vector of non-negative weights, same length as \code{observed}.
Default is \code{NULL}, which sets all weights to 1.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, prints estimated sigma, Shapiro-Wilk p-value, and log-likelihood.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value representing the total log-likelihood.
}
\description{
Computes the total log-likelihood for continuous data under the Normal distribution.
Also performs the Shapiro-Wilk test to check normality of residuals. Each observation
can be weighted via \code{weights}.
}
\details{
Weighted log-likelihood is computed across all observations, and the residuals are tested
for normality via the Shapiro-Wilk test:
\itemize{
\item If \code{p < 0.05}, a warning is issued indicating non-normal residuals.
\item Otherwise, if \code{verbose = TRUE}, a message is printed showing the p-value.
}
}
\examples{
ll <- calc_log_likelihood_normal(c(1.2, 2.8, 3.1), c(1.0, 3.0, 3.2))
print(ll)
