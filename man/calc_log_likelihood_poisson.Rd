\title{Calculate log-likelihood for Poisson-distributed count data}
\usage{
calc_log_likelihood_poisson(
  observed,
  estimated,
  weights = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{observed}{Integer vector of observed non-negative counts (e.g., cases, deaths).}

\item{estimated}{Numeric vector of expected values from the model (same length as \code{observed}).}

\item{weights}{Optional numeric vector of non-negative weights, same length as \code{observed}.
Default is \code{NULL}, which sets all weights to 1.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, prints diagnostics and total log-likelihood.}
}
\value{
A scalar representing the total log-likelihood (numeric).
}
\description{
Computes the total log-likelihood for integer count data under the Poisson distribution.
Each observation can be weighted via \code{weights}, defaulting to equal weights.
}
\details{
The Poisson distribution assumes that the variance equals the mean, \\( \\text{Var}(Y) = \\mu \\).
Weighted log-likelihood is summed across observations. If the variance/mean ratio is > 1.5,
a warning about possible overdispersion is issued.
