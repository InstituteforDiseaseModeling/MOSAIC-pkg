\title{Calculate Predictive Batch Size for Near-Complete Convergence}
\usage{
calc_predictive_batch_size(
  ess_history,
  target_ess,
  safety_factor = 0.9,
  max_batch_size = 10000,
  confidence_threshold = 0.7
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ess_history}{List of ESS measurements from calibration phase}

\item{target_ess}{Target ESS value for convergence}

\item{safety_factor}{Factor to apply (e.g., 0.9 = aim for 90\% of needed sims)}

\item{max_batch_size}{Maximum allowed batch size}

\item{confidence_threshold}{Minimum R-squared for prediction (default: 0.7)}
}
\value{
List with recommended batch size and prediction details
}
\description{
After calibration phase, predicts the number of simulations needed to
reach near-convergence (e.g., 90-95\% of target) in a single large batch.
