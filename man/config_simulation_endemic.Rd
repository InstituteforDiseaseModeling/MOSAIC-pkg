\title{LASER Configuration for an endemic simulation}
\format{
A named \strong{list} identical in structure to
\link{config_simulation_epidemic} but spanning 5 years of daily timesteps.
}
\usage{
config_simulation_endemic
}
\description{
A \strong{long-horizon endemic} parameter set that sustains low-level
transmission with seasonal and multi-year waves driven by environmental
persistence.  The object is created by
\code{make_simulation_endemic_LASER_config_files.R} and is intended for
demonstrations of equilibrium behaviour, immunity waning, and repeated
outbreaks.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item \strong{Time frame:} 1 January 2020 – 31 December 2034 (≈ 5 500 days).
\item \strong{Locations:} “FOO”, “BAR”, “BAZ” with populations 8 k, 12 k, 20 k.
\item \strong{Initial immunity/infection mix:} 48 \% susceptible, 30 \% vaccinated,
20 \% recovered, 1.5 \% exposed, 0.5 \% infectious.
\item \strong{Seasonality & environment:}
• Annual β forcing amplitude ≈0.10 with random phase per site.
• Environmental suitability (\code{psi_jt}) combines annual and 4-year sine
components; vibrios persist ~1 year (\code{decay_days_long = 365}).
\item \strong{Immunity waning:} \verb{omega_1 ≈ 1/180}, \verb{omega_2 ≈ 1/300} days.
}

The long duration and environmental carry-over allow recovered and
vaccinated individuals to lose protection, replenishing susceptibles and
producing recurrent outbreaks that resemble real-world endemic dynamics.
