\title{Temporal Disaggregation of Annual Cases to Daily Resolution}
\usage{
disagg_annual_cases_to_daily(annual_cases, years, a1, b1, a2, b2)
}
\arguments{
\item{annual_cases}{Vector of annual case counts}

\item{years}{Vector of years corresponding to cases}

\item{a1}{First harmonic cosine coefficient}

\item{b1}{First harmonic sine coefficient}

\item{a2}{Second harmonic cosine coefficient}

\item{b2}{Second harmonic sine coefficient}
}
\value{
Data frame with columns: date, year, day_of_year, cases, annual_total
}
\description{
Disaggregates annual cholera case counts to daily resolution using Fourier series
seasonal patterns. Ensures exact preservation of annual totals.
