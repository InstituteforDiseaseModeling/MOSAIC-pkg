\usage{
download_all_country_shapefiles(PATHS)
}
\arguments{
\item{PATHS}{A list containing the paths where processed data should be saved.
PATHS is typically the output of the \code{get_paths()} function and should include:
\itemize{
\item \strong{DATA_PROCESSED}: Path to the directory where the processed shapefiles should be saved.
}}
}
\value{
The function does not return a value. It downloads the shapefiles for each African country and saves them as individual shapefiles in the processed data directory.
}
\description{
This function downloads shapefiles for each African country and saves them in a specified directory.
The function iterates through ISO3 country codes for Africa (from the MOSAIC framework) and saves each country's shapefile individually.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Creates the output directory for shapefiles if it does not exist.
\item Loops through the list of ISO3 country codes for African countries.
\item Downloads each country's shapefile using \code{MOSAIC::get_country_shp()}.
\item Saves the shapefile in the processed data directory as \code{ISO3_ADM0.shp}.
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Define paths for processed data using get_paths()
PATHS <- get_paths()

# Download and save shapefiles for all African countries
download_all_country_shapefiles(PATHS)
}
