\title{Cholera Epidemic Peaks Data}
\format{
A data frame with 5 variables:
\describe{
\item{iso_code}{ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country code}
\item{peak_start}{Start date of the epidemic period (Date)}
\item{peak_date}{Date of peak incidence (Date)}
\item{peak_stop}{End date of the epidemic period (Date)}
\item{reported_cases}{Number of reported cholera cases at peak (numeric)}
}
}
\source{
Generated from cholera surveillance data using \code{est_epidemic_peaks()}
function on combined daily surveillance data from WHO and other sources.
}
\usage{
epidemic_peaks
}
\description{
A dataset containing identified epidemic peaks from cholera surveillance data
across African countries. Peaks are detected using time series analysis with
smoothing and prominence-based peak detection algorithms.
}
\details{
Epidemic peaks are identified using the following methodology:
\itemize{
\item Time series smoothing with 21-day running mean window
\item Local maxima detection with 7-day comparison windows
\item Prominence-based filtering (minimum 10\\% of maximum smoothed value)
\item Minimum peak height threshold of 10 smoothed cases
\item Minimum 90-day separation between consecutive peaks
\item Peak boundaries defined where incidence drops to 1/3 of peak height
}

Country-specific adjustments are applied for:
\itemize{
\item Niger (NER): Lower prominence threshold (2\\%) for gradual peaks
\item Cameroon (CMR): Adjusted threshold (5\\%) for plateau-shaped peaks
\item Ethiopia (ETH): Standard threshold (7\\%) for multiple outbreaks
}

Manual corrections have been applied for known issues including:
\itemize{
\item Ethiopia 2024: February peak corrected to March (sustained outbreak)
\item DRC 2023: Added January peak (filtered due to proximity)
\item Nigeria 2024: Added October peak
\item Kenya 2022-2023: Added December 2022, removed June 2023 minor peak
\item Mozambique: Added February 2024 and March 2025 peaks
\item Somalia: Added major April 2017 peak and 2024-2025 peaks
\item Zambia: Added January 2018 peak
\item Tanzania: Added January 2017 peak
}
