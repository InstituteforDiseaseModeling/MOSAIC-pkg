\title{Estimate Daily Demographic Rates from UN World Population Prospects Data}
\usage{
est_demographic_rates(PATHS, date_start, date_stop, smooth_method)
}
\arguments{
\item{PATHS}{A list containing paths where raw and processed data are stored.
PATHS is typically the output of the \code{get_paths()} function and should include the following components:
\itemize{
\item \strong{DATA_RAW}: Path to the directory containing the raw UN World Population Prospects data.
\item \strong{DATA_PROCESSED}: Path to the directory where processed demographic data should be saved.
\item \strong{DATA_WHO_ANNUAL}: Path to the directory containing annual WHO cholera mortality data.
\item \strong{MODEL_INPUT}: Path to the directory where model input parameter files should be saved.
}}

\item{date_start}{The starting date for demographic parameters. Accepts \code{Date} class objects or valid character strings.}

\item{date_stop}{The ending date for data demographic parameters. Must be in a valid date format (same as \code{date_start}).}

\item{smooth_method}{The method used to smooth annual demographic rates when converting them to a daily time scale.
Must be one of the following:
\itemize{
\item \strong{"none"}: No smoothing applied (annual values transposed to daily time scale).
\item \strong{"linear"}: Applies simple moving average smoothing.
\item \strong{"spline"}: Uses cubic spline interpolation for smoothing.
}}
}
\value{
The function does not return a value. It estimates demographic rates and saves the results as
CSV files containing population size, birth rates, and death rates over time.
}
\description{
This function estimates daily population, birth rates, and death rates for countries in the MOSAIC framework based on
the UN World Population Prospects data. The function interpolates annual demographic data to daily
values and applies an optional smoothing method to generate continuous time-series estimates. The function can produce
smoothed times series of any length from 1967 to 2100 (the extent of processed UN data and model projections).
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Filters the demographic data for the specified date range.
\item Converts annual birth and death rates to daily estimates.
\item Removes reported cholera deaths from all-cause mortality estimates.
\item Applies the chosen smoothing method to daily demographic rates.
\item Saves the processed data and model parameters to the specified directory.
}
The processed data file is saved in \verb{PATHS$DATA_PROCESSED/demographics/}, and the model input parameters
are stored in \verb{PATHS$MODEL_INPUT/}.
