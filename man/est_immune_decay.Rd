\title{Estimate Immune Decay}
\usage{
est_immune_decay(PATHS)
}
\arguments{
\item{PATHS}{A list containing the paths where data and figures are saved. Typically generated by the \code{get_paths()} function and should include:
\itemize{
\item \strong{DATA_IMMUNE_DURABILITY}: Path to the directory containing the immune durability data.
\item \strong{DOCS_FIGURES}: Path to the directory where the plots will be saved.
}}
}
\description{
This function estimates immune durability by fitting a proportional decay model to the data.
It uses nonlinear least squares fitting (NLS) to estimate decay parameters and generates plots
for predicted immune durability and decay rate distributions.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming PATHS is generated from get_paths()
PATHS <- get_paths()
est_immune_decay(PATHS)
}
