\usage{
est_initial_E_I_location(
  cases,
  dates,
  population,
  t0,
  lookback_days = 60,
  sigma,
  rho,
  chi,
  tau_r,
  iota,
  gamma_1,
  gamma_2,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cases}{Vector of daily suspected cholera cases (must be same length as dates)}

\item{dates}{Vector of dates corresponding to cases (Date class)}

\item{population}{Total population of the location (must be positive)}

\item{t0}{Target date for estimation (Date class)}

\item{lookback_days}{Days of data to use (default 60, must be positive)}

\item{sigma}{Symptomatic proportion (must be in (0,1])}

\item{rho}{Reporting rate - proportion of symptomatic cases reported (must be in (0,1])}

\item{chi}{Diagnostic positivity - proportion of suspected cases that are true cholera (must be in (0,1])}

\item{tau_r}{Reporting delay in days from symptom onset to report (must be non-negative)}

\item{iota}{Incubation rate (1/incubation period, must be positive)}

\item{gamma_1}{Symptomatic recovery rate (must be positive)}

\item{gamma_2}{Asymptomatic recovery rate (must be positive)}

\item{verbose}{Print detailed progress (default FALSE)}
}
\value{
A list with two components:
\describe{
\item{E}{Number of individuals in Exposed compartment (non-negative numeric)}
\item{I}{Number of individuals in Infected compartment (non-negative numeric)}
}

Returns E=0, I=0 if no cases in lookback window. Includes numerical stability
protections and parameter validation. Warns if E or I exceed 2\% of population.
}
\description{
This function performs the actual E/I estimation for a single location using
surveillance data and epidemiological parameters. It back-calculates true infections
from reported cases using the surveillance cascade, accounts for infection-to-report
delays, and estimates current E and I compartments based on disease progression.
}
\details{
The function includes comprehensive parameter validation, numerical stability
protections for exponential calculations, and detailed progress reporting when verbose=TRUE.
Uses exact infectiousness kernels for the I compartment estimation.
