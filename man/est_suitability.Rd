\title{Estimate Environmental Suitability (psi) for Cholera Transmission}
\usage{
est_suitability(
  PATHS,
  include_lagged_covariates = FALSE,
  fit_date_start = NULL,
  fit_date_stop = NULL,
  pred_date_start = NULL,
  pred_date_stop = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{PATHS}{A list containing paths where the data is stored. Typically generated by the \code{get_paths()} function and should include:
\itemize{
\item \strong{DATA_CHOLERA_WEEKLY}: Path to the directory containing processed combined weekly cholera cases data (WHO+JHU+SUPP sources).
\item \strong{DATA_ELEVATION}: Path to the directory where elevation data is stored.
\item \strong{MODEL_INPUT}: Path to save the processed model inputs and outputs.
\item \strong{DOCS_FIGURES}: Path to save the generated plots.
}}

\item{include_lagged_covariates}{Logical. Whether to include 1-7 day lagged versions of environmental covariates (default FALSE).}

\item{fit_date_start}{Date string or NULL. Start date for model fitting period. If NULL, auto-detects from first cholera case data.}

\item{fit_date_stop}{Date string or NULL. End date for model fitting period. If NULL, auto-detects from last date with both cholera cases and complete ENSO data.}

\item{pred_date_start}{Date string or NULL. Start date for prediction period. If NULL, uses fit_date_start.}

\item{pred_date_stop}{Date string or NULL. End date for prediction period. If NULL, auto-detects from last date with complete ENSO data.}
}
\value{
This function processes climate and cholera case data, fits an LSTM model, makes predictions on
environmental suitability (psi), and saves both the predictions and covariate data. It also
generates a plot showing the model fit (accuracy and loss over training epochs) and saves it to a
specified directory.
}
\description{
This function loads climate data, ENSO data, and weekly cholera cases data to estimate the environmental
suitability for cholera transmission based on various environmental factors. It uses lagged climate
covariates, scales them, and then fits an LSTM-based RNN model to predict cholera outbreaks. The model
is trained using past cholera case data and climate conditions, and predictions are made for environmental
suitability (psi) based on the climate covariates.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\itemize{
\item Loads processed climate and cholera data.
\item Creates lagged versions of relevant climate variables (e.g., temperature, precipitation, ENSO data).
\item Scales the climate covariates.
\item Splits the data into training and test sets.
\item Builds an LSTM-based recurrent neural network (RNN) model for predicting cholera outbreaks.
\item Trains the model on the training set and evaluates its performance on the test set.
\item Makes predictions on both the test set and the full dataset.
\item Saves the predictions, covariate data, and model fit plots to the specified directories.
}
}
\note{
The LSTM model uses climate variables to predict cholera suitability. The model's predictions are saved as
a CSV file and a plot showing the model fit (accuracy and loss) is generated.
