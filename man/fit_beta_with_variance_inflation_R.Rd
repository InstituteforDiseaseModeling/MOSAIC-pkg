\title{Helper Function to Fit Beta Distribution with Variance Inflation for est_initial_R}
\usage{
fit_beta_with_variance_inflation_R(samples, variance_inflation = 0, label = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{samples}{Numeric vector of proportions in (0,1)}

\item{variance_inflation}{Numeric inflation factor}

\item{label}{Character string for error messages}
}
\value{
List with shape1 and shape2 parameters, or NULL if fitting fails
}
\description{
Fits Beta distribution using CI expansion method with variance inflation.
Uses sqrt(variance_inflation) for CI expansion since variance scales as the square
of standard deviation. Falls back to method of moments with direct variance scaling.
