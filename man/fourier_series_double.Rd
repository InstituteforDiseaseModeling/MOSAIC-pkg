\usage{
fourier_series_double(t, beta0, a1, b1, a2, b2, p)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{A numeric vector representing time points (e.g., day of the year or week of the year).}

\item{beta0}{A numeric value representing the intercept term (fixed at 0 by default).}

\item{a1}{A numeric value representing the amplitude of the first cosine term (first harmonic).}

\item{b1}{A numeric value representing the amplitude of the first sine term (first harmonic).}

\item{a2}{A numeric value representing the amplitude of the second cosine term (second harmonic).}

\item{b2}{A numeric value representing the amplitude of the second sine term (second harmonic).}

\item{p}{A numeric value representing the period of the seasonal cycle (e.g., 52 for weekly data over a year).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of predicted values based on the Fourier series model.
}
\description{
This function implements a generalized Fourier series model with two harmonics in the sine-cosine form. The model is often used to capture seasonal or periodic dynamics in time series data, such as temperature, precipitation, or disease cases.
}
\details{
The model is defined as follows:
\deqn{\beta_t = \beta_0 + a_1 \cos\left(\frac{2 \pi t}{p}\right) + b_1 \sin\left(\frac{2 \pi t}{p}\right) + a_2 \cos\left(\frac{4 \pi t}{p}\right) + b_2 \sin\left(\frac{4 \pi t}{p}\right)}
The model includes an intercept term \code{beta0} (set to 0 by default) and two harmonics with coefficients \code{a1}, \code{b1}, \code{a2}, and \code{b2}. The period \code{p} controls the periodicity of the series.

This function is based on the sine-cosine form of the Fourier series. For more details, see the Wikipedia page on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series}{Fourier series}.

This function is commonly used for modeling seasonal dynamics in environmental or epidemiological data, where periodic patterns are observed.
