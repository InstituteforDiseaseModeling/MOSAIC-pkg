\usage{
get_WHO_vaccination_data(PATHS)
}
\arguments{
\item{PATHS}{A list of file paths, which should include the following element:
\describe{
\item{DATA_SCRAPE_WHO_VACCINATION}{The path to the folder where the processed vaccination data will be saved as a CSV file.}
}}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the processed WHO vaccination request data. The function also prints summary information,

}
\description{
This function processes raw WHO vaccination request data and converts it into a format suitable for use in the MOSAIC cholera model.
It extracts relevant information from tab-separated text data for various years, such as the year, country, request number, status,
context, ICG decision date, number of doses requested, approved, and shipped, as well as the date of the vaccination campaign.
The data is compiled into a data frame and saved to a CSV format for further analysis.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\itemize{
\item Reads raw vaccination request data from tab-separated text for multiple years (e.g., 2016-2024).
\item Extracts relevant columns such as Year, Country, Request Number, Status, Context, Decision Date, Doses Requested, Approved, and Shipped.
\item Handles missing values and checks for duplicated rows, removing duplicates and printing which rows were removed.
\item Summarizes the data, printing the total number of observations, total doses requested, approved, and shipped, as well as the first and last decision dates.
\item Saves the processed vaccination data to a CSV file in the location specified by the \code{PATHS} argument.
