\title{Create Binary Environmental Suitability Indicator from Case Data}
\usage{
get_cases_binary(data, cutoff = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing cholera surveillance data with columns:
\itemize{
\item \strong{iso_code}: ISO country code
\item \strong{cases}: Weekly cholera case counts
\item \strong{date_start}: Start date of each week (for ordering)
}}

\item{cutoff}{Numeric threshold for case counts. Weeks with cases >= cutoff are considered
outbreak periods. Default is 1 (any cases).}
}
\value{
The input data frame with an additional \code{cases_binary} column containing
the binary environmental suitability indicator (0 = unsuitable, 1 = suitable).
}
\description{
This function creates a binary indicator of environmental suitability for cholera transmission
based on case count data. It uses sophisticated temporal logic to identify not only outbreak
periods but also the environmental conditions leading up to outbreaks, which may be more
predictive of future transmission risk.
}
\details{
The environmental suitability logic works as follows:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Primary identification}: Weeks with cases >= cutoff are marked as suitable (1)
\item \strong{Lead-up period}: The week immediately before any outbreak week is marked as suitable
\item \strong{Extended lead-up}: If two consecutive weeks have cases >= cutoff, then 2-3 weeks before are also marked as suitable
}

This approach recognizes that environmental conditions favorable for cholera transmission
typically develop in the weeks preceding observable outbreaks. By marking these lead-up
periods as "suitable," the model can learn to predict environmental suitability before
cases are reported, which is more useful for early warning systems.

\strong{Missing Data Handling}: Weeks with missing case data (NA) are preserved as NA
in the binary indicator and are never retroactively marked as suitable during the
lead-up period logic. This prevents false environmental suitability signals during
periods with poor surveillance coverage.

The function processes each country separately to ensure that temporal relationships
are maintained within each location's outbreak history.
}
\note{
The temporal logic requires data to be ordered by date within each country. The function
will sort the data appropriately, but for best performance, input data should already
be ordered by iso_code and date_start.

\dontrun{
# Load cholera case data
data <- read.csv("cholera_weekly_data.csv")

# Create binary suitability indicator with default cutoff
data_with_binary <- get_cases_binary(data)

# Use higher cutoff for more conservative outbreak definition
data_with_binary <- get_cases_binary(data, cutoff = 10)
}
