\title{Create Binary Environmental Suitability Indicator from Epidemic Peaks}
\usage{
get_cases_binary_from_peaks(PATHS)
}
\arguments{
\item{PATHS}{List of paths generated by get_paths() containing MODEL_INPUT path for accessing
the epidemic peaks data file.}
}
\value{
A function that takes a data frame and returns it with an additional \code{cases_binary}
column containing the binary environmental suitability indicator (0 = unsuitable, 1 = suitable).
The input data frame must contain columns: \code{iso_code} and \code{date}.
}
\description{
This function creates a deterministic binary indicator of environmental suitability for cholera
transmission based on epidemic peak periods identified by the \code{est_epidemic_peaks()} function.
It uses the exact peak_start and peak_stop dates without any modifications or lead-up periods.
}
\details{
This function implements a deterministic approach for creating environmental suitability indicators:

\strong{Deterministic Epidemic Peak Method:}
\enumerate{
\item Loads epidemic peak periods from \code{param_epidemic_peaks.csv}
\item Marks all weeks from \code{peak_start} to \code{peak_stop} as suitable (1)
\item Uses exact dates without any lead-up periods or duration filters
\item Countries without epidemic peaks have cases_binary = 0 for all periods
}

\strong{Key Features:}
\itemize{
\item Deterministic behavior - no parameters that can alter the peak periods
\item Direct use of peak_start and peak_stop dates from epidemic analysis
\item No fallback methods or threshold-based logic
\item Preserves missing data periods (NA) as non-suitable
}
}
\note{
Requires \code{param_epidemic_peaks.csv} file generated by \code{est_epidemic_peaks()}.
If this file is missing, the function will stop with an error.
