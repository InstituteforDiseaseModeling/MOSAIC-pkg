\title{Get Immune Decay Data}
\usage{
get_immune_decay_data(PATHS)
}
\arguments{
\item{PATHS}{A list containing the paths where data and figures are saved. Typically generated by the \code{get_paths()} function and should include:
\itemize{
\item \strong{DATA_IMMUNE_DURABILITY}: Path to the directory where the immune durability data will be saved.
}}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns: day, effectiveness, effectiveness_hi, effectiveness_lo, and source.
}
\description{
This function retrieves immune durability data based on known values from various studies.
The data includes time (in days), effectiveness, and confidence intervals from studies.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming PATHS is generated from get_paths()
PATHS <- get_paths()
immune_data <- get_immune_decay_data(PATHS)
print(immune_data)
}
