\usage{
get_initial_compartment_values(
  N,
  prop_S,
  prop_E,
  prop_I,
  prop_R,
  prop_V1,
  prop_V2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{Numeric vector of total population sizes (non-negative integers). Names, if present, denote location identifiers and will be preserved across all compartments.}

\item{prop_S}{Numeric vector of susceptible proportions. Can be length 1 or same length as \code{N}.}

\item{prop_E}{Numeric vector of exposed proportions. Can be length 1 or same length as \code{N}.}

\item{prop_I}{Numeric vector of infected proportions. Can be length 1 or same length as \code{N}.}

\item{prop_R}{Numeric vector of recovered proportions. Can be length 1 or same length as \code{N}.}

\item{prop_V1}{Numeric vector of single-dose vaccinated proportions. Can be length 1 or same length as \code{N}.}

\item{prop_V2}{Numeric vector of two-dose vaccinated proportions. Can be length 1 or same length as \code{N}.}
}
\value{
A \code{list} with elements \code{N}, \code{S}, \code{E}, \code{I}, \code{R}, \code{V1}, \code{V2}, each an integer vector of length \code{length(N)} such that \code{N = S + E + I + R + V1 + V2}. All compartments inherit names from \code{N}, if provided.
}
\description{
Computes integer counts for compartments based on total population size and provided proportions.
}
\details{
The function checks that the sum of provided proportions equals 1 for each location. If they do not, it issues a warning and rescales the proportions so that they sum to 1 before computing counts. It then rounds counts, ensures all outputs are integer type, and distributes any rounding differences to the compartment with the largest proportion so that compartments sum exactly to \code{N}.
