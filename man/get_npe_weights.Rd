\title{Get NPE Importance Weights}
\usage{
get_npe_weights(bfrs_results, strategy = "binary_best", verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{bfrs_results}{BFRS results object containing weight_retained and weight_best}

\item{strategy}{Weight strategy:
"continuous_all" - Gibbs weights for all simulations (effective AIC range = 25)
"binary_all" - Equal weights for all simulations
"continuous_retained" - Use BFRS continuous weights for retained subset
"binary_retained" - Equal weights for all retained simulations
"continuous_best" - Use BFRS continuous weights for best subset
"binary_best" - Equal weights for all best subset simulations}

\item{verbose}{Print weight statistics}
}
\value{
Vector of normalized weights
}
\description{
Retrieves or creates importance weights for NPE training from BFRS results.
This function selects the appropriate pre-calculated BFRS weights or creates
binary versions of them, avoiding recalculation issues.
