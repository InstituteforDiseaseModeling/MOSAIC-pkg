\description{
This function generates a JSON/HDF5/YAML configuration file to be used as LASER model simulation parameters.
It validates all input parameters and, if an output file path is provided, writes the parameters to a file.
The file extension determines which output format is used:
\itemize{
\item .json or .json.gz → written with write_list_to_json,
\item .h5, or .h5.gz → written with write_list_to_hdf5,
\item .yaml or .yaml.gz → written with write_list_to_yaml.
