\value{
Returns the validated list of parameters. If \code{output_file_path} is provided, the parameters are also written to a YAML file.
}
\description{
This function generates a YAML file for MOSAIC model simulation parameters or returns the parameters as a list if no file output is specified.
It validates all input parameters to ensure they meet the required constraints for the MOSAIC simulation framework.
}
\details{
This function is designed for use with the MOSAIC R package and ensures compatibility with downstream Python-based tools.
