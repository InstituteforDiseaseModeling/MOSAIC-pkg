\title{Plot Binary Environmental Suitability Indicator with Case Data}
\usage{
plot_cases_binary(PATHS)
}
\arguments{
\item{PATHS}{A list containing paths where the data is stored. Must include:
\itemize{
\item \strong{DATA_CHOLERA_WEEKLY}: Path to combined weekly cholera surveillance data (WHO+JHU+SUPP)
\item \strong{DOCS_FIGURES}: Path where the generated plot will be saved
}}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the ggplot object after displaying and saving it.
}
\description{
This function creates a visualization showing cholera case counts over time with shaded regions
indicating periods identified as environmentally suitable for cholera transmission. The environmental
suitability is determined using sophisticated temporal logic that considers not only outbreak periods
but also lead-up weeks when conditions become favorable.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\itemize{
\item Loads processed suitability data containing pre-computed \code{cases_binary} indicators
\item Uses the existing binary environmental suitability indicators from the main pipeline
\item Generates a multi-panel plot showing case counts as bars with shaded regions
indicating environmentally suitable periods
\item Saves the plot as a PNG file to the figures directory
}

The shaded regions represent periods identified as environmentally suitable by the
\code{process_suitability_data()} pipeline, including both outbreak periods and
lead-up weeks when conditions become favorable.
