\title{Plot Downscaled Cholera Data}
\usage{
plot_downscaled_cholera_data(PATHS, iso)
}
\arguments{
\item{PATHS}{A named list of file paths. Required elements include:
\itemize{
\item \code{DATA_WHO_WEEKLY} - Directory containing the weekly data file
\code{"cholera_country_weekly_processed.csv"}.
\item \code{DATA_WHO_DAILY} - Directory containing the daily data file
\code{"cholera_country_daily_processed.csv"}.
\item \code{DOCS_FIGURES} - Directory in which the output PNG file will be saved.
}}

\item{iso}{A character string representing the ISO code of the target country (e.g., "ETH").}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL}. The function produces a combined two-panel plot, which is printed
to the active graphics device and saved as a PNG file.
}
\description{
This function generates a two-panel plot that visualizes daily cholera cases and deaths
for a specific country, based on downscaled weekly and daily data. The top panel shows
reported cholera cases and the bottom panel shows reported cholera deaths. Both panels
use a log-transformation (with a log(cases + 1) and log(deaths + 1) scale) while the y-axis
is labeled with raw counts. Data for the specified country are filtered by its ISO code,
and the function converts the ISO code to the country name using \code{MOSAIC::convert_iso_to_country}.
}
\details{
The function reads input CSV files from the directories specified in \code{PATHS} and saves
the resulting combined plot as a PNG file in the directory specified by \code{PATHS$DOCS_FIGURES}.

The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Reads in weekly and daily CSV files and converts date strings to \code{Date} objects.
\item Filters the data for the target country using its ISO code.
\item Separates the valid and missing daily entries for both cases and deaths.
\item Constructs two ggplot2 objects: one for cases (upper panel) and one for deaths (lower panel),
applying a log-transformation with custom y-axis breaks and labels.
\item Combines the two panels vertically using the \code{patchwork} package and saves the plot as a PNG file.
