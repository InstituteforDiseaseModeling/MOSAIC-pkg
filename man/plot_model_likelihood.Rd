\title{Plot Model Likelihood Curve}
\usage{
plot_model_likelihood(results, output_dir, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{results}{A data frame containing calibration results with at minimum
a 'likelihood' column, and optionally 'sim' and 'iter' columns for
identifying individual simulations. This is typically the output from
a model calibration run.}

\item{output_dir}{Character string specifying the directory where the plot
should be saved. Directory will be created if it doesn't exist.}

\item{verbose}{Logical indicating whether to print messages. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the ggplot object for the likelihood curve.
}
\description{
Creates a sorted likelihood curve plot showing the performance of all
calibration simulations. The plot displays simulations sorted by their
log-likelihood values, with the best simulation highlighted.
}
\details{
This function creates a publication-quality plot showing:
\itemize{
\item All simulations sorted by log-likelihood (x-axis: simulation index, y-axis: log-likelihood)
\item A smooth line connecting all points to show the curve
\item Individual points for each simulation
\item The best simulation highlighted with a red point
\item A horizontal dotted line at the maximum likelihood value
}

The plot helps visualize:
\itemize{
\item The overall calibration performance
\item The distribution of likelihood values
\item How many simulations achieved good fits
\item Whether there's a clear optimum or multiple good solutions
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Run calibration and collect results
results <- run_calibration()

# Create likelihood curve plot
p_likelihood <- plot_model_likelihood(
    results = results,
    output_dir = "calibration_output"
)

# The plot is automatically saved, but you can also access it
print(p_likelihood)
}
