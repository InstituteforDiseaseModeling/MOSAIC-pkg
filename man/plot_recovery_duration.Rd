\title{Plot recovery durations and rates for symptomatic and asymptomatic infections}
\usage{
plot_recovery_duration(
  PATHS = NULL,
  symp_range = c(3, 7),
  asymp_range = c(7, 14)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{PATHS}{Optional list containing output paths. If provided, must include \code{DOCS_FIGURES} where plot will be saved.}

\item{symp_range}{A numeric vector of length 2 indicating the minimum and maximum shedding duration (in days) for symptomatic infections. Default is c(3, 7).}

\item{asymp_range}{A numeric vector of length 2 indicating the minimum and maximum shedding duration (in days) for asymptomatic infections. Default is c(7, 14).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the ggplot object. If \code{PATHS} is supplied, also saves a PNG.
}
\description{
This function visualizes the assumed shedding durations and corresponding recovery rates
(1/duration) for symptomatic and asymptomatic cholera infections using transparent bars
and solid mean lines. Recovery duration is shown on the x-axis.
}
\details{
If a list \code{PATHS} is provided with a valid \code{DOCS_FIGURES} element, the plot will also be
saved as a PNG in that directory as "recovery_rates.png".

\examples{
plot_recovery_duration()
plot_recovery_duration(symp_range = c(4, 6), asymp_range = c(8, 12))
