\title{Plot Clustering of Countries Based on Seasonal Dynamics}
\usage{
plot_seasonal_clustering(
  PATHS,
  use_cases = FALSE,
  set_inferred_to_na = TRUE,
  clustering_method = "hierarchical",
  k = 4
)
}
\arguments{
\item{PATHS}{A list containing paths where processed climate, cholera, and fitted data are stored. Typically generated by the \code{get_paths()} function and should include:
\itemize{
\item \strong{DATA_SHAPEFILES}: Path to the directory containing shapefiles for African countries.
\item \strong{DOCS_TABLES}: Path to load the processed precipitation, fitted values, and clustering results.
\item \strong{DOCS_FIGURES}: Path to save the output plot.
}}

\item{use_cases}{A logical value. If \code{TRUE}, clustering is based on Fourier series fitted to cholera cases. If \code{FALSE}, clustering is based on precipitation.}

\item{set_inferred_to_na}{A logical value. If \code{TRUE}, inferred countries are set to \code{NA} in the clustering. Default is \code{TRUE} when using precipitation, \code{FALSE} when using cases.}

\item{clustering_method}{A character string specifying the clustering method. Options are \code{"kmeans"}, \code{"hierarchical"}, \code{"dbscan"}, or \code{"knn"}. Default is \code{"hierarchical"}.}

\item{k}{An integer specifying the number of clusters for k-means and hierarchical clustering. Default is 4.}
}
\value{
The function generates and saves a PNG file showing the clustering of countries based on seasonal dynamics.
}
\description{
This function visualizes the clustering of countries based on seasonal precipitation or cholera cases. It generates a map showing the clusters, and a multi-panel plot showing the fitted Fourier series values for each cluster.
