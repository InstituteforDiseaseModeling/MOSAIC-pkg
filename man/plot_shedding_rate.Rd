\title{Plot Shedding Rate as a Function of Environmental Suitability}
\usage{
plot_shedding_rate(PATHS)
}
\arguments{
\item{PATHS}{A list containing the paths where the plot will be saved. Typically generated by the \code{get_paths()} function and should include:
\itemize{
\item \strong{DOCS_FIGURES}: Path to the directory where the plot will be saved.
}}
}
\description{
This function generates a plot that visualizes the suitability-dependent decay rate of environmental shedding based on climate-driven environmental suitability (\eqn{\psi_{jt}}). The function generates three models for the decay rate \eqn{\delta_{jt}}:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{\delta_{jt} = 1 - \psi_{jt}}: A simple linear transformation of \eqn{\psi_{jt}}.
\item \eqn{\delta_{jt} = 1 - \frac{1}{1 + (1 - \psi_{jt})}}: A nonlinear transformation of \eqn{\psi_{jt}}.
\item \eqn{\delta_{jt} = \delta_{\min} + \psi_{jt} \cdot (\delta_{\max} - \delta_{\min})}: A linear transformation based on minimum and maximum decay rates.
}
The plot is saved as a PNG file in the directory specified by \code{PATHS$DOCS_FIGURES}.
