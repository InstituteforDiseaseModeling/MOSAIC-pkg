\title{Plot Predicted Suitability and Reported Cholera Cases for a Specific Country}
\usage{
plot_suitability_and_cases(PATHS, plot_iso_code)
}
\arguments{
\item{PATHS}{A list of paths to the directories where data is stored and plots will be saved.
Must include MODEL_INPUT (for reading prediction files) and DOCS_FIGURES (for saving plots).}

\item{plot_iso_code}{The ISO code of the country to plot (e.g., "AGO", "CMR").}
}
\value{
A combined plot showing both cholera case bars and smoothed suitability predictions
for the specified country.
}
\description{
This function plots the reported cholera cases and predicted environmental suitability
for a specific country over time, with shaded regions indicating cholera outbreaks.
Requires that est_suitability() has been run first to generate prediction files.
}
\details{
The function reads pred_psi_suitability_day.csv created by est_suitability(),
which contains: date, cases, pred, pred_smooth, and iso_code columns.
