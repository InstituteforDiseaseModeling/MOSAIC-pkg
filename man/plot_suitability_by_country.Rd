\title{Plot Predicted Suitability for All Countries}
\usage{
plot_suitability_by_country(PATHS)
}
\arguments{
\item{PATHS}{A list of paths to the directories where data is stored and plots will be saved.
Must include MODEL_INPUT (for reading prediction files) and DOCS_FIGURES (for saving plots).}
}
\value{
A facet plot of predicted environmental suitability for all countries, filtered to
years >= 2021. The plot includes smoothed suitability predictions and shaded regions
indicating periods with cholera cases.
}
\description{
This function generates a facet plot of predicted environmental suitability for all countries
over time, with shaded regions indicating cholera outbreaks. Requires that est_suitability()
has been run first to generate the necessary prediction files.
}
\details{
The function merges data from two files created by est_suitability():
\itemize{
\item pred_psi_suitability_week.csv - Contains smoothed predictions (pred_smooth)
\item data_psi_suitability.csv - Contains country names and outbreak indicators
}
}
