\title{Plot Vaccine Effectiveness Decay and Prior Distributions}
\usage{
plot_vaccine_effectiveness(PATHS)
}
\arguments{
\item{PATHS}{A list containing the paths where the figures will be saved. Typically generated by the \code{get_paths()} function and should include:
\itemize{
\item \strong{MODEL_INPUT}: Path to the directory containing the vaccine effectiveness data and parameters
\item \strong{DOCS_FIGURES}: Path to the directory where the figures will be saved
}}
}
\description{
This function generates comprehensive plots showing vaccine effectiveness decay over time and
prior distributions for both one-dose and two-dose OCV regimens. It creates three sets of figures:
one for one-dose OCV, one for two-dose OCV, and a combined figure showing both regimens.
}
\details{
The function creates the following plots:
\itemize{
\item \strong{One-dose OCV (A-C)}: Decay curve, phi_1 prior distribution, omega_1 prior distribution (blue theme)
\item \strong{Two-dose OCV (D-F)}: Decay curve, phi_2 prior distribution, omega_2 prior distribution (green theme)
}

Three PDF files are saved:
\itemize{
\item \code{vaccine_one_dose_combined.pdf}: One-dose vaccine effectiveness plots
\item \code{vaccine_two_dose_combined.pdf}: Two-dose vaccine effectiveness plots
\item \code{vaccine_all_combined.pdf}: Both regimens combined in a single figure
}
}
