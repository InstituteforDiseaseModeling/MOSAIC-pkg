\title{Process UN World Prospects Data for African Countries}
\usage{
process_UN_demographics_data(PATHS)
}
\arguments{
\item{PATHS}{A list containing paths where raw and processed data are stored.
PATHS is typically the output of the \code{get_paths()} function and should include the following components:
\itemize{
\item \strong{DATA_RAW}: Path to the directory containing the raw UN World Population Prospects data.
\item \strong{DATA_PROCESSED}: Path to the directory where processed demographic data should be saved.
}}
}
\value{
The function does not return a value. It processes the UN demographic data and saves both
annual and daily interpolated results as CSV files in the specified directory.
}
\description{
This function processes demographic data from the UN World Population Prospects for African countries.
It loads available data, gets total population, birth rates, and death rates, and saves the processed
data as both annual and daily CSV files. The daily data is created through linear interpolation.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Loads raw demographic data from CSV files.
\item Merges population, birth rate, and death rate data.
\item Saves the annual data as \code{UN_world_population_prospects_annual.csv}.
\item Creates daily interpolated data using linear interpolation between annual values.
\item Saves the daily data as \code{UN_world_population_prospects_daily.csv}.
}
The processed data files will be saved in the \verb{PATHS$DATA_PROCESSED/demographics/} directory.
