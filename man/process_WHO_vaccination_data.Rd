\title{Process Vaccination Data for MOSAIC Model}
\usage{
process_WHO_vaccination_data(PATHS)
}
\arguments{
\item{PATHS}{A list containing file paths for input and output data. The list should include:
\itemize{
\item \strong{DATA_DEMOGRAPHICS}: Path to the directory where demographic data is stored.
\item \strong{DATA_SCRAPE_WHO_VACCINATION}: Path to the directory containing raw WHO vaccination data.
\item \strong{MODEL_INPUT}: Path to the directory where processed vaccination data will be saved.
}}
}
\value{
The function saves the processed vaccination data to a CSV file in the directory specified by \code{PATHS$MODEL_INPUT}. It also returns the processed data as a data frame for further use in R.
}
\description{
This function processes raw vaccination data from WHO and associated population data to create a clean, structured dataset for the MOSAIC model. It handles data cleaning, infers missing campaign dates, validates the dataset, and saves the output for use in modeling cholera vaccination efforts.
}
\details{
This function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Load and Filter Demographic Data}:
- Reads demographic data for African countries from a CSV file.
- Filters the data for the year 2023 and retains population sizes.
\item \strong{Load and Clean Vaccination Data}:
- Reads raw WHO vaccination data.
- Converts country names to ISO codes for consistency.
- Filters the data to include only countries in the MOSAIC database.
\item \strong{Infer Missing Campaign Dates}:
- Computes the delay between decision and campaign dates.
- Infers missing campaign dates based on the mean delay where possible.
- Fixes missing decision dates for grouped request numbers.
\item \strong{Validate and Filter Data}:
- Ensures all rows have valid campaign dates.
- Removes rows where \code{doses_shipped} is zero or missing.
\item \strong{Save Processed Data}:
- Writes the cleaned and processed dataset to a CSV file for further modeling.
