\title{Process Country Similarity Data for African Countries}
\usage{
process_country_similarity_data(PATHS)
}
\arguments{
\item{PATHS}{A list containing the paths where raw and processed data are stored. Typically generated by the \code{get_paths()} function, and should include:
\itemize{
\item \strong{DATA_RAW}: Path to the directory containing the raw similarity matrix data.
\item \strong{DATA_SIMILARITY_MATRIX}: Path to the directory where the processed African similarity matrix will be saved.
}}
}
\value{
The function saves the processed similarity matrix for African countries in the specified directory.
}
\description{
This function processes a global country similarity distance matrix and extracts the subset of African countries, normalizes country names, and matches them to ISO3 codes. The resulting matrix for African countries is saved as a CSV file.
}
\details{
This function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Loads a global similarity distance matrix from a CSV file.
\item Normalizes country names to title case and replaces non-standard names like "Ivory Coast" with "CÃ´te d'Ivoire" to match ISO3 country standards.
\item Subsets the matrix to only include African countries, based on ISO3 codes provided by \code{MOSAIC::iso_codes_africa}.
\item Outputs a CSV file containing the similarity matrix for African countries, with row and column names in ISO3 format.
}
