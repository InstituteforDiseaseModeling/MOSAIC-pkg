\title{Process Environmental Suitability Data for Cholera Transmission}
\usage{
process_suitability_data(PATHS, cutoff)
}
\arguments{
\item{PATHS}{A list containing paths where the data is stored. Typically generated by the \code{get_paths()} function and should include:
\itemize{
\item \strong{DATA_CLIMATE}: Path to the directory where processed climate data is stored.
\item \strong{DATA_ENSO}: Path to the directory where ENSO data is stored.
\item \strong{DATA_CHOLERA_WEEKLY}: Path to the directory containing processed combined weekly cholera cases data (WHO+JHU+SUPP sources).
}}

\item{cutoff}{Numeric threshold for case counts. Weeks with cases >= cutoff are considered
outbreak periods for the environmental suitability calculation. Default behavior uses this
value to create the binary indicator.}
}
\value{
This function processes the data and merges the climate, ENSO, and cholera cases data into a single dataset. It creates a \code{cases_binary} column indicating environmental suitability based on case patterns using sophisticated temporal logic. The processed dataset is saved as a CSV file.
}
\description{
This function loads climate data, ENSO data, and weekly cholera cases data, processes them, and merges them into a dataset to estimate the environmental suitability for cholera transmission based on various environmental factors. It also creates a binary environmental suitability indicator based on case patterns.
}
\details{
The function performs the following key steps:
\itemize{
\item Loads and merges climate data (temperature, precipitation, etc.) from multiple countries
\item Loads ENSO and DMI climate index data
\item Loads combined weekly cholera case surveillance data from WHO, JHU, and supplemental sources
\item Merges all datasets by country, year, and week
\item Creates environmental suitability indicator (\code{cases_binary}) that identifies not only outbreak weeks but also the environmental conditions leading up to outbreaks using temporal logic
\item Saves the complete merged dataset for use in environmental suitability modeling
}

The \code{cases_binary} indicator uses sophisticated logic to capture environmental suitability periods,
including lead-up weeks before observable outbreaks, making it suitable for predictive modeling.

\code{\link{get_cases_binary}} for details on how the environmental suitability indicator is created.
