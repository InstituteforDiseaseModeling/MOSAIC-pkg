\title{Process Environmental Suitability Data for Cholera Transmission}
\usage{
process_suitability_data(
  PATHS,
  cutoff,
  use_epidemic_peaks = FALSE,
  date_start = NULL,
  date_stop = NULL,
  forecast_mode = TRUE,
  forecast_horizon = 3,
  include_lags = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{PATHS}{A list containing paths where the data is stored. Typically generated by the \code{get_paths()} function and should include:
\itemize{
\item \strong{DATA_CLIMATE}: Path to the directory where processed climate data is stored.
\item \strong{DATA_ENSO}: Path to the directory where ENSO data is stored.
\item \strong{DATA_CHOLERA_WEEKLY}: Path to the directory containing processed combined weekly cholera cases data (WHO+JHU+SUPP sources).
}}

\item{cutoff}{Numeric threshold for case counts. Used when use_epidemic_peaks = FALSE.
Weeks with cases >= cutoff are considered outbreak periods for the environmental
suitability calculation. Default behavior uses this value to create the binary indicator.}

\item{use_epidemic_peaks}{Logical. If TRUE, uses epidemic peak periods from
est_epidemic_peaks() to define environmental suitability using exact peak_start
to peak_stop dates. Provides deterministic outbreak detection without any
modifications or lead-up periods. Default FALSE for backwards compatibility.}

\item{date_start}{Optional start year for data filtering. If NULL, automatically determined
from case data (one year prior to earliest case observation).}

\item{date_stop}{Optional end year for data filtering. If NULL, automatically determined
from latest ENSO data availability.}

\item{forecast_mode}{Logical. If TRUE, only includes variables that can support forecasting
at the specified horizon. Excludes case-dependent epidemic memory and spatial import
pressure variables. Default TRUE.}

\item{forecast_horizon}{Numeric. Forecasting horizon in months. Variables dependent on
surveillance data beyond this horizon are excluded in forecast mode. Default 3 months.}

\item{include_lags}{Logical. If TRUE, includes time-lagged climate variables with
epidemiologically-informed lag periods specific to each variable. Default FALSE.}
}
\value{
This function processes the data and merges the climate, ENSO, and cholera cases data into a single dataset. It creates a \code{cases_binary} column indicating environmental suitability based on case patterns using sophisticated temporal logic. The processed dataset is saved as a CSV file.
}
\description{
This function loads climate data, ENSO data, and weekly cholera cases data, processes them, and merges them into a dataset to estimate the environmental suitability for cholera transmission based on various environmental factors. It also creates a binary environmental suitability indicator based on case patterns.
}
\details{
The function performs the following key steps:
\itemize{
\item Loads and merges climate data (temperature, precipitation, etc.) from multiple countries
\item Loads ENSO and DMI climate index data
\item Loads combined weekly cholera case surveillance data from WHO, JHU, and supplemental sources
\item Merges all datasets by country, year, and week
\item Creates environmental suitability indicator (\code{cases_binary}) using either epidemic peak-based or threshold-based methods
\item Saves the complete merged dataset for use in environmental suitability modeling
}

\strong{Environmental Suitability Methods:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{Epidemic Peak-based} (use_epidemic_peaks = TRUE): Uses deterministic outbreak detection from est_epidemic_peaks() using exact peak_start to peak_stop dates without any modifications
\item \strong{Threshold-based} (use_epidemic_peaks = FALSE): Uses simple case count cutoffs with temporal lead-up logic
}

The epidemic peak-based method provides deterministic, epidemiologically meaningful outbreak periods
and is recommended for consistent environmental suitability modeling.
