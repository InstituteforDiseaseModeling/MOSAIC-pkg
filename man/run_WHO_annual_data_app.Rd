\title{Run Shiny Application for Visualizing WHO Annual Cholera Data in AFRO Countries}
\usage{
run_WHO_annual_data_app(PATHS)
}
\arguments{
\item{PATHS}{A list containing paths to the processed cholera data file. Typically generated by the \code{get_paths()} function and should include:
\itemize{
\item \strong{DATA_WHO_ANNUAL}: Path to the directory containing the processed cholera data file (e.g., \code{who_afro_annual_1949_2024.csv}).
}}
}
\description{
This function launches a Shiny app that visualizes cholera cases, deaths, and case fatality rate (CFR) for countries in the AFRO region from 1970 to 2024. Users can select a metric (cases, deaths, or CFR) and filter by specific countries.
}
\details{
This function creates a Shiny app that allows users to explore cholera incidence data across AFRO countries from 1970 to 2024. Users can choose between viewing cases, deaths, or CFR and can select specific countries for visualization. The app generates bar plots for cases and deaths, and point plots with error bars for CFR.
}
\note{
This function requires the optional \code{shiny} package.
Install with: \code{install.packages("shiny")}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Define paths for processed data
PATHS <- get_paths()

# Run the cholera Shiny app
run_WHO_annual_data_app(PATHS)
}
