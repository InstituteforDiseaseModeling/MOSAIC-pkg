\usage{
use_mosaic_env()
}
\value{
Invisible TRUE if successful, FALSE otherwise.
}
\description{
\strong{Note}: This function is maintained for backward compatibility.
For new code, use \code{\link{attach_mosaic_env}} instead.

Switches the current R session to use the MOSAIC Python environment
at ~/.virtualenvs/r-mosaic. This function attempts to switch from other
Python environments (like r-keras) to the MOSAIC environment.
}
\details{
This function attempts to switch the Python environment mid-session.
Due to reticulate limitations, if Python has already been initialized
with a different environment, a complete switch may require restarting R.
The function will provide appropriate guidance based on the current state.

\strong{Recommended}: Use \code{\link{attach_mosaic_env}} for clearer semantics
and better error handling. The Python environment is now automatically
attached when you load MOSAIC via \code{library(MOSAIC)}.

# Old approach (still works)
