\title{Use MOSAIC Python Environment}
\usage{
use_mosaic_env()
}
\value{
Invisible TRUE if successful, FALSE otherwise.
}
\description{
Switches the current R session to use the MOSAIC Python environment
at ~/.virtualenvs/r-mosaic. This function attempts to switch from other
Python environments (like r-keras) to the MOSAIC environment.
}
\details{
This function attempts to switch the Python environment mid-session.
Due to reticulate limitations, if Python has already been initialized
with a different environment, a complete switch may require restarting R.
The function will provide appropriate guidance based on the current state.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Switch to MOSAIC environment after using est_suitability()
use_mosaic_env()

# At the start of an R session
library(MOSAIC)
use_mosaic_env()
}
