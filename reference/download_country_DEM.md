# Download 1km DEM Raster for Multiple Countries and Save to Files

This function downloads 1km resolution DEM (Digital Elevation Model)
raster data for a given vector of ISO3 country codes, and writes each
raster to a GeoTIFF file.

## Usage

``` r
download_country_DEM(PATHS, iso_codes, zoom_level = 6)
```

## Arguments

- PATHS:

  A list containing paths where DEM data will be saved. Typically
  generated by the
  [`get_paths()`](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/MOSAIC-pkg/reference/get_paths.md)
  function and should include:

  - **DATA_DEM**: Path to the directory where DEM rasters will be saved.

- iso_codes:

  A character vector of ISO3 country codes for which DEM data should be
  downloaded.

- zoom_level:

  An integer representing the zoom level for the DEM data. Zoom levels
  6-8 are recommended for 1km resolution (default = 6).

## Value

The function does not return a value. It downloads the DEM data for each
country and saves the results as GeoTIFF files in the specified
directory.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
# Define the ISO3 country codes
iso_codes <- c("ZAF", "KEN", "NGA")

# Get paths for data storage
PATHS <- get_paths()

# Download DEM rasters for the countries
download_country_DEM(iso_codes, PATHS)
} # }
```
