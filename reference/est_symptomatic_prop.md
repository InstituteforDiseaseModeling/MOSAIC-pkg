# Estimate and Visualize Symptomatic Proportion Data

This function reads the symptomatic proportion data, fits a Beta
distribution to simulate the proportion of infections that are
symptomatic, and generates visualizations comparing estimates from
previous studies.

## Usage

``` r
est_symptomatic_prop(PATHS)
```

## Arguments

- PATHS:

  A list containing paths where the symptomatic proportion data and
  figures should be saved. Typically generated by the
  [`get_paths()`](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/MOSAIC-pkg/reference/get_paths.md)
  function and should include:

  - **DATA_PROCESSED**: Path to the symptomatic proportion data.

  - **DOCS_FIGURES**: Path to save the generated plots.

## Value

The function does not return a value but generates and saves plots to a
PNG file.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
# Estimate and visualize symptomatic proportion data
PATHS <- get_paths()
est_symptomatic_prop(PATHS)
} # }
```
