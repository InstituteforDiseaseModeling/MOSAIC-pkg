# Estimate the Generation Time Distribution for Days and Weeks

This function generates the probability distribution of the generation
time for cholera based on a gamma distribution. It allows the
specification of the mean generation time, which adjusts the shape and
rate parameters. The day-wise and week-wise probabilities are saved as
CSV files.

## Usage

``` r
get_generation_time_distribution(PATHS, mean_generation_time)
```

## Arguments

- PATHS:

  A list containing the paths where the output tables will be saved.
  Typically generated by the
  [`get_paths()`](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/MOSAIC-pkg/reference/get_paths.md)
  function and should include:

  - **MODEL_INPUT**: Path to the directory where model input data will
    be saved.

  - **DOCS_TABLES**: Path to the directory where day-wise and week-wise
    generation time tables will be saved.

- mean_generation_time:

  A numeric value representing the desired mean generation time (in
  days). This value is used to adjust the shape and rate parameters of
  the gamma distribution.
