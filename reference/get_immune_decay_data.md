# Get Immune Decay Data

This function retrieves immune durability data based on known values
from various studies. The data includes time (in days), effectiveness,
and confidence intervals from studies.

## Usage

``` r
get_immune_decay_data(PATHS)
```

## Arguments

- PATHS:

  A list containing the paths where data and figures are saved.
  Typically generated by the
  [`get_paths()`](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/MOSAIC-pkg/reference/get_paths.md)
  function and should include:

  - **DATA_IMMUNE_DURABILITY**: Path to the directory where the immune
    durability data will be saved.

## Value

A data frame with columns: day, effectiveness, effectiveness_hi,
effectiveness_lo, and source.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
# Assuming PATHS is generated from get_paths()
PATHS <- get_paths()
immune_data <- get_immune_decay_data(PATHS)
print(immune_data)
} # }
```
