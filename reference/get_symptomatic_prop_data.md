# Get Symptomatic Proportion Data

This function creates a data frame with studies reporting the proportion
of cholera infections that are symptomatic and saves it as a CSV file.

## Usage

``` r
get_symptomatic_prop_data(PATHS)
```

## Arguments

- PATHS:

  A list containing paths where the symptomatic proportion data should
  be saved. Typically generated by the
  [`get_paths()`](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/MOSAIC-pkg/reference/get_paths.md)
  function and should include:

  - **DATA_PROCESSED**: Path to save the symptomatic proportion data.

## Value

The function does not return a value but saves the data frame to a CSV
file.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
# Generate and save symptomatic proportion data
PATHS <- get_paths()
get_symptomatic_prop_data(PATHS)
} # }
```
