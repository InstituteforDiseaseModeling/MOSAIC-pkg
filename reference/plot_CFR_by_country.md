# Plot Case Fatality Ratios, Total Cases, and Beta Distributions by Country

This function creates two separate plots: one for case fatality ratios
(CFR) with confidence intervals and total cases by country, and another
for Beta distributions for selected countries. The plots are generated
based on cholera data stored in the `PATHS$DATA_WHO_ANNUAL` directory.

## Usage

``` r
plot_CFR_by_country(PATHS)
```

## Arguments

- PATHS:

  A list containing the paths where the cholera data and figures will be
  saved. Typically generated by the
  [`get_paths()`](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/MOSAIC-pkg/reference/get_paths.md)
  function and should include:

  - **DATA_WHO_ANNUAL**: Path to the directory where processed WHO
    annual cholera data is located.

  - **DOCS_FIGURES**: Path to the directory where the plots will be
    saved.

## Value

A list containing the two ggplot objects: one for CFR and total cases,
and one for Beta distributions.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
PATHS <- get_paths()
plot_CFR_by_country(PATHS)
} # }
```
