# Plot Weekly Climate Data for a Given Country and Save to File

This function loads weekly climate data from a Parquet file for a
specified country ISO code and plots a faceted plot showing all
available climate variables over time. A vertical line indicates the
present day, and the plot is saved to the `DOCS_FIGURES` directory.

## Usage

``` r
plot_climate_data(PATHS, country_iso_code)
```

## Arguments

- PATHS:

  A list containing paths where climate data is stored. Typically
  generated by the
  [`get_paths()`](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/MOSAIC-pkg/reference/get_paths.md)
  function and should include:

  - **DATA_CLIMATE**: Path to the directory where the processed climate
    data is stored.

  - **DOCS_FIGURES**: Path to the directory where the output figures
    will be saved.

- country_iso_code:

  A character string representing the ISO3 code of the country for which
  to plot the climate data.

## Value

The function does not return a value but generates and saves a faceted
plot of the weekly climate data for the specified country.
