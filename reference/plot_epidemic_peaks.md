# Plot Epidemic Peaks from Detection Results

This function loads the epidemic peak detection results and creates a
multi-page PDF with time series plots showing cases and identified peaks
for each location.

## Usage

``` r
plot_epidemic_peaks(PATHS)
```

## Arguments

- PATHS:

  List of paths generated by get_paths() containing required data
  locations

## Value

NULL (creates PDF file as side effect)

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
# Set up paths and create visualization
set_root_directory("~/MOSAIC")
PATHS <- get_paths()

# Run peak detection first
est_epidemic_peaks(PATHS, method = 'algorithm')

# Create visualization PDF
plot_epidemic_peaks(PATHS)
} # }
```
