# Plot Generation Time as Gamma Distribution for Days and Weeks

This function generates a combined plot for the generation time
probability distribution over days (based on a gamma distribution) and
aggregated over weeks. The resulting plot is saved as a PNG file.

## Usage

``` r
plot_generation_time(PATHS)
```

## Arguments

- PATHS:

  A list containing the paths where the plot will be saved. Typically
  generated by the
  [`get_paths()`](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/MOSAIC-pkg/reference/get_paths.md)
  function and should include:

  - **DOCS_FIGURES**: Path to the directory where the generation time
    plot will be saved.
