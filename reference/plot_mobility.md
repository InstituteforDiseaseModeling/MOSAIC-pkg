# Plot Mobility Data, Mobility Network, and Results

This function loads and visualizes the mobility data, including the
flight data, travel probabilities, diffusion model estimates, and
mobility network.

## Usage

``` r
plot_mobility(PATHS)
```

## Arguments

- PATHS:

  A list containing paths where data, models, and figures are stored.
  Typically generated by the
  [`get_paths()`](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/MOSAIC-pkg/reference/get_paths.md)
  function and should include:

  - **MODEL_INPUT**: Path to the directory where the mobility matrices
    and parameter estimates are saved.

  - **DATA_SHAPEFILES**: Path to the directory containing shapefiles for
    African countries.

  - **DOCS_FIGURES**: Path to the directory where figures will be saved.

## Value

The function generates and saves mobility-related visualizations as PNG
files.
