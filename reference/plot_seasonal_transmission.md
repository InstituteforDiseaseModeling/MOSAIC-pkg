# Plot Precipitation and Cholera Case Data with Fourier Series Fits

This function visualizes the seasonal precipitation and cholera cases
data, fitted with a double Fourier series model. It generates a plot of
the Z-scored data for each country, indicating inferred countries where
cholera cases data was imputed from neighbors.

## Usage

``` r
plot_seasonal_transmission(PATHS)
```

## Arguments

- PATHS:

  A list containing paths where processed climate, cholera, and fitted
  data are stored. Typically generated by the get_paths() function and
  should include:

  - **DOCS_FIGURES**: Path to save the output plot.

## Value

The function generates and saves a PNG file showing the seasonal
dynamics of precipitation and cholera cases across multiple countries.
