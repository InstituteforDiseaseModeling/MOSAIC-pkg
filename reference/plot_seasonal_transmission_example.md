# Plot Seasonal Transmission Example with Grid Points

This function plots the map of a selected country with grid points used
for climate data sampling, and visualizes the seasonal transmission
dynamics using Fourier series for both precipitation and cholera cases.

## Usage

``` r
plot_seasonal_transmission_example(PATHS, country_iso_code, n_points = 30)
```

## Arguments

- PATHS:

  A list containing paths where processed climate, cholera, and fitted
  data are stored. Typically generated by the
  [`get_paths()`](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/MOSAIC-pkg/reference/get_paths.md)
  function and should include:

  - **DATA_SHAPEFILES**: Path to the directory containing shapefiles for
    African countries.

  - **DOCS_TABLES**: Path to load the processed precipitation and fitted
    values data.

  - **DOCS_FIGURES**: Path to save the output plot.

- country_iso_code:

  A character string representing the ISO3 code of the country to plot.

- n_points:

  An integer specifying the number of grid points to generate within the
  country for sampling.

## Value

The function generates and saves a PNG file showing the grid points on
the country map and the seasonal transmission dynamics.
