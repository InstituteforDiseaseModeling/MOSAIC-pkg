# Plot Shedding Rate as a Function of Environmental Suitability

This function generates a plot that visualizes the suitability-dependent
decay rate of environmental shedding based on climate-driven
environmental suitability (\\\psi\_{jt}\\). The function generates three
models for the decay rate \\\delta\_{jt}\\:

- \\\delta\_{jt} = 1 - \psi\_{jt}\\: A simple linear transformation of
  \\\psi\_{jt}\\.

- \\\delta\_{jt} = 1 - \frac{1}{1 + (1 - \psi\_{jt})}\\: A nonlinear
  transformation of \\\psi\_{jt}\\.

- \\\delta\_{jt} = \delta\_{\min} + \psi\_{jt} \cdot (\delta\_{\max} -
  \delta\_{\min})\\: A linear transformation based on minimum and
  maximum decay rates.

The plot is saved as a PNG file in the directory specified by
`PATHS$DOCS_FIGURES`.

## Usage

``` r
plot_shedding_rate(PATHS)
```

## Arguments

- PATHS:

  A list containing the paths where the plot will be saved. Typically
  generated by the
  [`get_paths()`](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/MOSAIC-pkg/reference/get_paths.md)
  function and should include:

  - **DOCS_FIGURES**: Path to the directory where the plot will be
    saved.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
# Assuming PATHS is generated from get_paths()
PATHS <- get_paths()
plot_shedding_rate(PATHS)
} # }
```
