# Plot Proportion of Suspected Cholera Cases

This function loads the parameter data frame for the proportion of
suspected cholera cases (rho) from the `param_rho_suspected_cases.csv`
file and generates a plot showing the probability distributions for both
low and high estimates, with custom annotations and formatting.

## Usage

``` r
plot_suspected_cases(PATHS)
```

## Arguments

- PATHS:

  A list containing paths where the parameter data and figures will be
  saved. Typically generated by the
  [`get_paths()`](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/MOSAIC-pkg/reference/get_paths.md)
  function and should include:

  - **MODEL_INPUT**: Path to the directory where the parameter data
    frame is stored.

  - **DOCS_FIGURES**: Path to the directory where the plot will be
    saved.
