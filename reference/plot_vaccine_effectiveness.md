# Plot Vaccine Effectiveness Decay and Prior Distributions

This function generates comprehensive plots showing vaccine
effectiveness decay over time and prior distributions for both one-dose
and two-dose OCV regimens. It creates three sets of figures: one for
one-dose OCV, one for two-dose OCV, and a combined figure showing both
regimens.

## Usage

``` r
plot_vaccine_effectiveness(PATHS)
```

## Arguments

- PATHS:

  A list containing the paths where the figures will be saved. Typically
  generated by the
  [`get_paths()`](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/MOSAIC-pkg/reference/get_paths.md)
  function and should include:

  - **MODEL_INPUT**: Path to the directory containing the vaccine
    effectiveness data and parameters

  - **DOCS_FIGURES**: Path to the directory where the figures will be
    saved

## Details

The function creates the following plots:

- **One-dose OCV (A-C)**: Decay curve, phi_1 prior distribution, omega_1
  prior distribution (blue theme)

- **Two-dose OCV (D-F)**: Decay curve, phi_2 prior distribution, omega_2
  prior distribution (green theme)

Three PDF files are saved:

- `vaccine_one_dose_combined.pdf`: One-dose vaccine effectiveness plots

- `vaccine_two_dose_combined.pdf`: Two-dose vaccine effectiveness plots

- `vaccine_all_combined.pdf`: Both regimens combined in a single figure
