# Process Cholera Data to Calculate Aggregated Case Fatality Ratios and Fit Beta Distributions (2014-2024)

This function processes cholera data, aggregates cases and deaths for
each country over the period 2014-2024, calculates the aggregated Case
Fatality Ratio (CFR), and fits Beta distributions for each country.
Countries with fewer cases than `min_obs` will have their CFR set to the
value of the AFRO Region.

## Usage

``` r
process_CFR_data(PATHS, min_obs)
```

## Arguments

- PATHS:

  A list containing the paths where the cholera data is located.
  Typically generated by the
  [`get_paths()`](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/MOSAIC-pkg/reference/get_paths.md)
  function and should include:

  - **DATA_WHO_ANNUAL**: Path to the directory containing processed WHO
    annual cholera data.

  - **DOCS_TABLES**: Path to the directory where processed CFR data will
    be saved.

- min_obs:

  An integer specifying the minimum number of cases required for a
  country to have its own CFR. Countries with fewer cases than this
  threshold will have their CFR set to the value of the AFRO Region.

## Value

A data frame with aggregated CFR, confidence intervals, and Beta
distribution parameters for each country.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
PATHS <- get_paths()
cholera_data <- process_CFR_data(PATHS, min_obs = 100)
} # }
```
