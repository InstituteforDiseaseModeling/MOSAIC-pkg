# Process and Aggregate Climate Data for Each Country

This function processes the climate data downloaded using the
`download_climate_data` function. It creates three aggregated datasets:
daily, weekly, and monthly, for each country and saves them as Parquet
files with the country ISO code included in the file name.

## Usage

``` r
process_climate_data(PATHS)
```

## Arguments

- PATHS:

  A list containing paths where climate data is stored and processed.
  Typically generated by the
  [`get_paths()`](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/MOSAIC-pkg/reference/get_paths.md)
  function and should include:

  - **DATA_RAW**: Path to the directory where the raw climate data is
    stored.

  - **DATA_CLIMATE**: Path to the directory where the processed climate
    data will be saved.

## Value

The function does not return a value. It processes the climate data and
saves the daily, weekly, and monthly aggregated datasets for each
country in Parquet format.
