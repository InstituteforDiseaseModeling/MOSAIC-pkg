# Run Shiny Application for Visualizing WHO Annual Cholera Data in AFRO Countries

This function launches a Shiny app that visualizes cholera cases,
deaths, and case fatality rate (CFR) for countries in the AFRO region
from 1970 to 2024. Users can select a metric (cases, deaths, or CFR) and
filter by specific countries.

## Usage

``` r
run_WHO_annual_data_app(PATHS)
```

## Arguments

- PATHS:

  A list containing paths to the processed cholera data file. Typically
  generated by the
  [`get_paths()`](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/MOSAIC-pkg/reference/get_paths.md)
  function and should include:

  - **DATA_WHO_ANNUAL**: Path to the directory containing the processed
    cholera data file (e.g., `who_afro_annual_1949_2024.csv`).

## Details

This function creates a Shiny app that allows users to explore cholera
incidence data across AFRO countries from 1970 to 2024. Users can choose
between viewing cases, deaths, or CFR and can select specific countries
for visualization. The app generates bar plots for cases and deaths, and
point plots with error bars for CFR.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
# Define paths for processed data
PATHS <- get_paths()

# Run the cholera Shiny app
run_WHO_annual_data_app(PATHS)
} # }
```
